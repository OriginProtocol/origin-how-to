# Origin Marketplace Listing Guide

This guide will tell you how to list goods and services on the [Origin Marketplace DApp](https://dapp.originprotocol.com). While there are several steps in the process, we hope this step-by-step guide will make it easy for you to create your first listing in 10 minutes or less. 

Please contact the Origin team if you have any questions and one of us will walk you through this process. You can email at [info@originprotocol.com](mailto:info@originprotocol.com).

## Get an Ethereum Wallet

To use the Origin Marketplace DApp or Ethereum DApps in general, you will need to have an Ethereum wallet and wallet-enabled browser. 

### Desktop

On desktop, we recommend using a browser extension called [Metamask](https://metamask.io/). This extension works with Chrome, Firefox, Opera, and Brave browser. MetaMask acts as an Ethereum wallet that allows you to interface with web applications. Every Ethereum wallet has something called a seed phrase (or private keys). This seed phrase is extremely important to backup and you can use it to recover or move your funds even if you lose the password to MetaMask. If you lose the seed phrase and get locked out of MetaMask, you lose your funds.

Check out this [short video guide](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZIGUC9JAAw8) that explains how to install and set up MetaMask.

If you don’t have any ETH (short for ether, or Ethereum coins) and don’t want to buy any for yourself, we will send you a tiny amount (about $0.05) to create your listing. Contact Origin with your MetaMask wallet address (also called a public key), provide details about your listing, and we will send you some ETH for free.

### Mobile

On iOS and Android, there are many popular mobile wallets like our very own Origin Wallet ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/origin-wallet/id1446091928)), Coinbase Wallet ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/app/coinbase-wallet/id1278383455?ls=1&mt=8), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.toshi)), and TrustWallet ([iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/trust-ethereum-wallet/id1288339409), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.wallet.crypto.trustapp)).

Each of these apps will generate a wallet for you (or allow you to import an existing one). Once you have your wallet set up, you will be able to browse DApps.

## Using Ethereum

The rest of this guide walks you through the desktop browser experience, but similar recommendations apply for mobile.

In order to use DApps, you will often need need some ETH to complete actions on the Ethereum network (called paying for gas). Most actions only cost about a penny or less in gas. Sometimes you will need to sign something using your wallet as well, which is a free user interaction and does not cost any gas. 

Either way, if you are stuck or need to do something, keep an eye out on the little fox logo in your browser bar and any notifications. Click the button to pop up MetaMask and complete a transaction or sign something.

When you want to sell your ETH for dollars or another currency, we recommend using [Coinbase](https://coinbase.com). You can send ETH to your account on Coinbase and exchange it for dollars that can then be withdrawn to your bank account.

## Using the Origin Marketplace DApp

After you have MetaMask up and running, navigate to the [Origin Marketplace DApp](https://dapp.originprotocol.com). The first thing you should do is set up a profile so buyers know who you are. This is important to build trust, as buyers will want to know who they are transacting with.

### Setting up a Profile
Click the icon in the top right corner and click ‘Edit Profile’ or go directly to the [profile page](https://dapp.originprotocol.com/#/profile).
