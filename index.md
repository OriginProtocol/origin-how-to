# Origin Decentralized App Listing Guide

This guide will tell you how to list goods and services on the [Origin DApp marketplace](https://dapp.originprotocol.com). While there are several steps in the process, we hope this step-by-step guide will make it easy for you to create your first listing in 10 minutes or less. 

Please contact the Origin team if you have any questions and one of us will walk you through this process. You can email at [info@originprotocol.com](mailto:info@originprotocol.com).
